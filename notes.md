1. When I enter the URL into the datasource, it automtically validates. THen I select the sheet. it validates that. Then the sheet selector disappears, rather than showing the column selector. I have to select the sheet again, then, on the 2nd time, the column selector shows up. Something broke here in the last update. 
2. Under "Email Subject Line". Let's rename "Available Placeholders" to "Available Placeholders from Data Source"
3. The CC/BCC Override Optiosn button doesn't do anything. Nothing drops down. I'd expect buttons for me to override CC or BCC independenlty, plus a value for those fields. 
4. The Send Test Email no longer works. Just sits there spinning. Nothing gets sent. 
5. During the Data Source configuration, let me know via a toaster alert how many receiptints you've found. In fact, if you're doing different things during this phase, pop toaster alerts up. 
6. Under Summary, rename "Recipients" as "Recipients Column".
