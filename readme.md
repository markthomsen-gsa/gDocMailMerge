## Improvement Ideas
- Offer button for summary dialogue; get's too cluttered
- Link sheet enumeration to receipient calculaation (refresh)
- Send summary email after job completes; to include what fails.
- Can we learn more about why things are failing
- Sending from a different delegated email. 
- Check quota before send. [when to do this?]
- Placeholder insights - what's used and not used in document 


When is the appropraite time to calcuate quota limits?
